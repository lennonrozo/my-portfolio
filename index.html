    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Lennon Rozo, and I am majoring in computer science. My career aspiration is to become a full stack
        software developer because I am passionate about problem solving. <br>Growing up in a poor neighborhood in Zimbabwe,
        I encountered many problems which often didn’t get solved quickly. As such, from an early age, I have always
        been intent on improving my problem-solving abilities to effectively contribute to my community. <br>
        Currently, I am proficient in programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, web technologies like HTML
        and CSS. I am actively elevating my skills working on database management frameworks and version control.
        I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team, and I would love to discuss roles in your
        organization which may align with my skills. <br>
        Finally, a little insight into my personality is that I am just as passionate solving puzzles as highlighted by
        my daily streak either playing chess or sudoku. I also love reading mystery novels because I enjoy the
        satisfaction that comes with getting to the end of the book and realizing I got it right. However, instead of
        staying indoors all the time, I also enjoy walking and hiking in nature, playing sports with friends. Family is
        everything to me, as such, I enjoy making food because I like to bring people together.
        I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your organization.
